My expertise relies on the details you provide in your descriptions.\n\nHowever, don't let that discourage you! You can paint a picture with your words! The more descriptive you are about the item, the better I can help. Tell me about:\n\n*   **The garment itself:** What is it? (Dress, top, pants, etc.) What's the fabric like? (Cotton, silk, denim, etc.) What color is it? What's the cut or silhouette? (A-line, fitted, oversized, etc.) Are there any special details like embellishments, ruffles, or unique closures?\n*   **The occasion:** Where are you planning to wear it? (Work, party, casual outing, etc.) What's the general vibe of the event?\n*   **Your personal style:** What are some of your favorite colors, patterns, and silhouettes? What kind of look are you going for? (Boho, classic, edgy, etc.)\n*   **Your body type:** This helps me suggest silhouettes that flatter your figure.\n*   **What you're hoping to achieve:** Do you want to look professional, relaxed, glamorous, or something else entirely?\n\nWith that information, I can give you incredible advice! Think of me as a stylist who relies on your keen observations. Let's give it a try! What are you thinking of describing?\n"
